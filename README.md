# Customizable Widget Dashboard

üöÄ ## Overview

This project is a dynamic, grid-based dashboard application built with Next.js and React. It allows users to arrange and interact with various widgets on a customizable grid. The dashboard features a sleek, dark-themed UI with a particle background and provides a foundation for a highly personalized user experience.

‚ú® ## Current Features

üõ†Ô∏è ## Getting Started

This is a Next.js project.

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable)**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    * Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
    * Add your Tomorrow.io API key for the Weather Widget:
        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_TOMORROW_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    * **Note on YouTube API Key**: The YouTube widget currently uses an API key (`AIzaSyAIsr27eVlsTIgd0kLM9Lq_WDr-vGbJjtI`) directly in the `YoutubeWidget.tsx` file. **WARNING**: Exposing API keys on the client side is insecure for production applications. For a real-world deployment, you should move API calls that require sensitive keys to a backend proxy.

4.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

üîÆ ## Future Ideas & Enhancements

While many features have been implemented, here are some areas for future development:

* **Enhanced Widget Discovery & Management**:
    * Filter widgets in the "Add Widget" menu by categories (e.g., "Productivity", "Entertainment").
    * More sophisticated auto-placement algorithms for new widgets.
* **More Widgets**:
    * Calendar integration.
    * News Feed (RSS).
    * Stock Ticker / Crypto Tracker.
* **Advanced Widget Features**:
    * **Clock**: Customizable analog faces, selectable fonts, date display, timezone selection.
    * **Notes**: More rich text formatting options, potential for tagging/organization.
* **Theming**: More advanced global theming options for the dashboard and widgets.
* **Accessibility Improvements**: Continuously review and enhance accessibility across all components.
* **Performance Optimization**: For dashboards with a large number of widgets or complex data.
* **Backend Integration**: For features requiring server-side logic or secure API key management (especially for the YouTube API).

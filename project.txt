Initial functionality ready -

Here's the proposed action plan:

File: src/app/page.tsx

    Define a LocalStorage Key:
        At the top of the file (or in your constants section), define a constant for the localStorage key. This makes it easy to change if needed and avoids typos.
        Example: const LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY = 'dashboardLayout';

    Modify Initial State Loading for widgets and history:
        The widgets state is currently initialized with initialWidgets. We need to change this to load from localStorage on the client-side after the initial render.
        Initial useState: Keep useState<PageWidgetConfig[]>(() => JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(initialWidgets))) for widgets and the corresponding history initialization. This ensures SSR compatibility and provides a default.
        New useEffect for Loading (Client-Side Only):
            Create a useEffect hook that runs only once on component mount (useEffect(() => { ... }, [])).
            Inside this effect:
                Check if window is defined (to ensure client-side).
                Attempt to retrieve the saved layout from localStorage using LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY.
                If data is found:
                    Use a try-catch block to parse the JSON string (JSON.parse(savedLayoutJSON)).
                    If parsing is successful and it's a valid array, update the widgets state with this loaded data (setWidgets(loadedWidgets)).
                    Crucially, also reset the history state to start with this loaded layout: setHistory([JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(loadedWidgets))]) and setHistoryPointer(0).
                If no data is found or parsing fails, the component will continue using the initialWidgets (or whatever widgets was already set to). We can log an error in case of parsing failure.

    Implement Saving to localStorage:
        New useEffect for Saving:
            Create another useEffect hook that depends on the widgets state (useEffect(() => { ... }, [widgets])).
            Inside this effect:
                Check if window is defined.
                To prevent saving the initialWidgets state immediately on first load before attempting to load from localStorage, we can use a useRef to track if the initial load attempt has completed. For example, const initialLoadAttempted = useRef(false);. Only save if initialLoadAttempted.current is true.
                Set initialLoadAttempted.current = true; in the loading useEffect after the attempt.
                Serialize the current widgets state to a JSON string (JSON.stringify(widgets)).
                Save this string to localStorage using LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY.
                Include basic error handling for localStorage.setItem (e.g., if storage is full, though less common for this amount of data).

    Review updateWidgetsAndPushToHistory:
        This function already updates the widgets state and the history state.
        The useEffect hook created in step 3 (which listens to widgets changes) will automatically handle saving the updated widgets array to localStorage. No direct localStorage.setItem call is needed inside updateWidgetsAndPushToHistory itself.

Summary of Changes in page.tsx:

    Add LOCAL_STORAGE_KEY constant.
    Add a useEffect for one-time loading from localStorage on mount, which also resets history if data is loaded.
    Add a useRef to track if the initial load has been attempted.
    Add a useEffect for saving to localStorage whenever widgets changes (and after the initial load attempt).

This plan ensures that:

    The app attempts to load a saved layout when it starts.
    Any changes to the layout are automatically saved.
    The undo/redo history correctly reflects the state, whether it's loaded from storage or started fresh.
    SSR compatibility is maintained by interacting with localStorage only on the client side.


We will take this one step at at a time, for each finished task, mark it completed in this file.
